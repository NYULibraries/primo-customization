    // ------- BEGIN: LIBKEY CODE -------
    // Originally the only LibKey code used in this controller after the LibKey
    // configuration code was moved to the CDN was this line:
    //
    //     window.browzine.primo.searchResult( $scope );
    //
    // ...which worked fine when running normally in a browser on Mac, but more
    // often than not error'ed out when running in CircleCI.  Here's one example:
    // https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/NYULibraries/primo-customization/126/workflows/68978317-ffe9-43f5-b937-7fa43dc85d96/jobs/106/parallel-runs/0/steps/0-103
    //
    // The error:
    //
    //     TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'searchResult')
    //     at Object.<anonymous> (http://primo-explore-devenv:8003/discovery/custom/01NYU_INST-NYU_DEV/js/custom.js:100:27)
    //
    // This appears to be due to a race condition where the components render
    // before the 3rd party `browzine-primo-adapter.js` script runs.  This script
    // is loaded into <head> and under normal conditions adds `browzine` to the
    // `window` object before Primo returns search results.
    //
    // Even before the LibKey configuration and <script> tag injection code was
    // moved to CDN, there were frequently e2e test failures when run in containers
    // (locally, as well as in CircleCI).  Increasing the test timeout seemed
    // to eliminate these failures.  After the code move to CDN, timeout increases
    // no longer seemed to help.
    //
    // Here we use a retry/timeout function which does continuous polling of the
    // DOM to determine when it can do its own DOM manipulations.
    // We set a limit on number of retries and duration of continuous polling,
    // to prevent wasteful infinite looping in the event of failure to load the
    // 3rd-party hosted `browzine-primo-adapter.js`.

    // Limit how long to wait for `browzine-primo-adapter.js` to 15 seconds.
    // Note that we can't use underscore numeric separators (e.g. 5_000 for 5,000) because
    // `primo-explore-devenv`'s `gulp-babel` flags it as a syntax error:
    // "Identifier directly after number"
