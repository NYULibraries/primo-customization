# Primo Customization for NYU

## ESLint configuration

ESLint is transitioning to a new configuration system:
[Configuration Files](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)

> Warning
> We are transitioning to a new config system in ESLint v9.0.0. The config system shared on this page is
> currently the default but will be deprecated in v9.0.0. You can opt-in to the new config system by
> following the instructions in the [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new).

We are opting-in to the new system by putting our configuration in _eslint.config.js_.
JetBrains does not appear to support the new system yet, and VS Code might not either (not confirmed).
To enable seamless linting in IDEs, we also have a script that generates and old style
_.eslintrc.cjs_ file from the new style _eslint.config.js_ config file, which will
be automatically detected by the JetBrain IDEs.

To regenerate _.eslintc.cjs_:

```shell
node scripts/write-eslintrc-cjs-file.js
```

Note that it is not really possible to have _.eslintrc.cjs_ import the rules directly
from _eslint.config.js_ because the former uses the CommonJS style module system
and the latter uses ESM.  Moreover, the _eslint.config.js_ spec specifies returning
an array and not an object, making import by CommonJS module _.eslintrc.cjs_ not
feasible.
