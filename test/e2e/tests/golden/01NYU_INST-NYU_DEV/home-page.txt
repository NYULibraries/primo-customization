Using the Catalog
What's in the Catalog Search?

Using the search bar on this page, you can find:

books / e-books
scholarly articles
journals / e-journals
newspapers and magazine articles
scores and scripts
videos and sound recordings
offsite materials
special collections

Resources are across all of NYU’s New York and global libraries.

Is everything that we have access to discoverable in the Catalog Search?

Not quite. All physical materials that NYU Libraries collect are in the Catalog Search. While the Catalog Search captures most of the e-resources the Libraries subscribes to, there are some e-resources that may not come up.

If the item that you are looking for does not appear in the Catalog Search, there may be other ways to find it:

Use the citation information that you have to navigate directly to the journal’s website by looking up the journal title in Catalog Search.
Do further research in subject-specific databases or WorldCat.
Ask a Librarian for help with locating the item.
Place an Interlibrary Loan (ILL) request; we’ll do our best to find a copy for you.

Collections Access
In-person access to library stacks:
If an item says “Available” in one of our libraries (not including an “Offsite” location, you may get it directly from the stacks.
If an item says “Available” at an Offsite location, use the “Request Physical Copy” or “Request Scan” options under the GetIt section of the record in the catalog record.

Locker pick-up, delivery, or digital scanning is also available, but may not be your fastest options. For details, visit the Collections Access page.

If an item says “Out of library”, you can use the “Request from partner libraries” link in the catalog record. This initiates an EZborrow or Interlibrary Loan (ILL) request.

What option should I choose?
If you need your item today and it is "Available" in the catalog, you can go directly to the stacks and get the item off the shelf. Use our maps to help navigate the stacks at Bobst Library.
If you can wait 3-5 days, request locker pick-up.
If there is no digital version and you do not need the full item, request a scan of 1-2 chapters.
