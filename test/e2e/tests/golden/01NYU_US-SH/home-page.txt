Collections Access
In-person access to library stacks: If an item says "Available" in one of our libraries, you may get items directly from the stacks. Use our floor map to navigate the stacks.
For items only available in print in New York, you may request a single chapter scan.
Any other chapter scan requests may be submitted via Interlibrary Loan (ILL).
If you require an entire book that is not available in the NYU Shanghai Collection, place an Interlibrary Loan request.
